# Restaurant Reservation System - Periodic Tables

This restaurant reservation fullstack application was made as my final project for Thinkful's Software Engineering certification program. It allows users to create, display, and edit reservations as well as tables. Users are able to seat reservations at tables and remove them when finished.
